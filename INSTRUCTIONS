Brief instructions for 'mhegenc'
--------------------------------
These are some simple instructions for the mhegenc ASN.1 <-> Text notation
convertor. These replace the README distributed with the source.

Encoding to ASN.1
-----------------

Simple encode:

        mhegenc -o outfile infile

if you miss out the outfile, it will take the infile (minus any extension) and
append .asn to make an out file (be careful, this will trash previous files).

Encoding to Textual Notation
----------------------------

Simple decode:

        mhegenc -d -o outfile infile

if you miss out the outfile, it will take the infile (minus any extension) and
append .mhg to make an out file (be careful, this will trash previous files).

Comments:
 To include comments (recomended) add the -c switch.

Options
-------
Debug:
 Only really usefull if you have the source: -d will instruct the parser to 
   dump traces (v. noisy)

Warnings and optimisation:
 -W and -O are barely supported, so it's not really worth it.

Language
--------
The language accepted should be UK-DTT 1.06 plus expressions. 

'C' preprocessor directives are ignored (not sure if that breaks the
language!) so cpp can be used to include definitions and name variables. 
 
The converter is fairly strict so tags must be in the order specified in the
ISO Appendix B. Please note that some problems have been experienced with
other converters that are not compliant and some source wont run through
both. Dispite this, we are sticking to the 'correct' language.

Simple expresions can be used anywhere that an INTERGER is expected. This was
implemented to make relative positioning eaisier.

NOTE: BASE64 is NOT implemented in this revision.
